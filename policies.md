### Class Practicum

Please bring your computer. You will not need to take notes (we will post all code and PowerPoint slides for each class), but we will be using `R` together in many classes.

### Working in groups

Work for the course will include both problem sets and a final project. For the problem sets, you are encouraged to work in groups. Your writeup must be your own, however. Please mark who you worked with on your writeup. For the final project, you must complete your own replication project, but you are encouraged to ask for help from your peers.

### Honor Code & Late Policy

One-half grade will be subtracted from the assigned grade for each day any assignment is submitted late. Please familiarize yourself with Stanford's honor code, available on the judicial affairs website. We will adhere to it and follow through on its penalty guidelines.

### Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, OAE website).
