## Course Overview

### Course Goals

Students completing Psych 254 will:

* Be able to perform a psychology experiment on the web,
* Be able to analyze a study in terms of reliability (e.g. power, statistical choices), and validity (e.g. design, sampling),
* Master best practices for experimental data management, storage, and analysis, and
* Have a reproducible workflow for experimental data analysis and visualization, including comfort with a variety of R packages, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and `lmer`.

### Pre-requisites

This course is a requirement for incoming graduate students in the Psychology department. It will be taught in the `R` statistical programming language and will be vastly easier if you have some prior experience with the language.

In addition, we will be relying heavily on version control using git and github. Please take a moment to set up a git account at https://github.com/, and to get it working on your computer before class starts.

### Readings

We will be using many of the techniques and workflows described in Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's book, [R for Data Scientists](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is available free online. I highly recommend using it as a reference book.

Two other great books that we will refer to occasionally:

* Gelman, A. & Hill, J. (2006). Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models. Cambridge University Press.

* Rosenthal, R., & Rosnow, R. L. (2008). Essentials of behavioral research: Methods and data analysis (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill.

### Problem Sets

We will have a number of problem sets on data wrangling and data analysis using R. All of these will need to be written as literate, reproducible analyses using R Markdown, and compiled into HTML. All problem sets should be turned in to the course instructors list

### Grading

* 40%: Problem Sets (4 problem sets);
* 50%: Final project components, including presentations, data collection, analysis, and writeup;
* 10%: Attendance and participation.

## Final Project

This course follows the model described in Frank & Saxe (2012) and Hawkins*, Smith* et al. (in press): we will be doing replications of recent published papers of interest in order to provide independent, converging evidence for the reproducibility of the scientific literature. The hope is that student projects will lead to broadly-useful knowledge about the viability of published results in an online context.

The final project for this course will be a high-quality, web-based replication of a single experiment from a published paper. Your goal will be a replication report, using the Open Science Collaboration replication template for the final writeup (http://www.openscienceframework.org) You can find more information at this link.

## Other Policies

### Class Practicum

Please bring your computer. You will not need to take notes (we will post all code and PowerPoint slides for each class), but we will be using R together in many classes.

### Working in groups

Work for the course will include both problem sets and a final project. For the problem sets, you are encouraged to work in groups. Your writeup must be your own, however. Please mark who you worked with on your writeup. For the final project, you must complete your own replication project, but you are encouraged to ask for help from your peers.

### Honor Code & Late Policy

One-half grade will be subtracted from the assigned grade for each day any assignment is submitted late. Please familiarize yourself with Stanford's honor code, available on the judicial affairs website. We will adhere to it and follow through on its penalty guidelines.

### Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, OAE website).
